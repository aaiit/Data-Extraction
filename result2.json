So is God the Father. And the Holy Ghost is also God.\nThe Bible says that Jesus thought it not robbery to consider himself equal to God. \nThe Catholics aren't the only one's whom believe in the Trinity. Pentecostals also believe in the Trinity; as do the Trinitarian Bible society.\nCatholics are guilty of idolatry because they worship statues of the saints; and they believe that Mary is equal to God. Us Baptist want no part of the Great harlot called catholicism.\nIf you want, I will post some quoted scripture of the King James Bibles to show that Jesus is part of the God head. We are King James Only (1611 version) so we take no part in these modern corrupted Bibles that twist the Word of God into a lie. \n\nIf you're impatiently waiting for my response, download a Bible Ap called Tecarta Bible (Google Playatore). It has a keyword search function that will definitely assist you in finding the answer to these questions. I read through the entire Bible Ap and it matches up with my 1611 King James Bible. Stay away from those modern Bibles that go by the label, NIV, ESV, New Living Translation, etc. The King James Bible is the true word of God. Not these modern books that delete verses and change them to lift up false doctrines such Zionism, Pretribulation Rapture, Work's based salvation, Lordship Salvation, Dispensationism, Ecumenicalism, and dozens of other damnable heresies.\nWe Baptist believe that once we're saved, we're always saved. We can NEVER lose our eternal salvation. Nay, not even if we wanted to. We are sealed onto the day of redemption.",
